    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform a clustering task over a simplified version of the [TrackML](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification) dataset, wherein each sample is reduced from $\\approx10^5$ points to only $\\approx 10^2$ points. TrackML's goal is to reconstruct the trajectory of particles created when proton bunches accelerated to near the speed of light collide. To capture the particles' paths, the particles pass through many layers of a detector (e.g., Atlas), resulting in a point cloud. Successfully clustering this point cloud such that each cluster is associated to one particle is sufficient for physicists to then extract the particles' trajectories and thus discover their kinematic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a simple algorithm that uses a GNN to learn a good embedding for classical clustering algorithm like DBSCAN. While end-to-end and hierarchical clustering is highly desirable, it presents additional challenges which go beyond the scope of this tutorial's purpose in featuring DGL. Interested readers may check out the algorithm introduced in [End-to-End Hierarchical Clustering with Graph Neural Networks](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/choma_nicholas.pdf)."

    "### Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Neural Networks are an attractive candidate since they are capable of aggregating information over variable-sized neighborhoods of points; there is no limitation of modeling just singular or pairwise interactions. Because we begin only with a point cloud, our pipeline will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metric learning:** Embed the points into a Euclidean space using an MLP on each point indivually. Points belonging to the same particle should be close; points belonging to different particles should be far. *(provided as input data)*\n",
    "1. **Graph Construction:** Find each point's nearest neighbors in the embedded space, and connect them with a graph. Ensure neighborhoods are large enough to connect most of the points belonging to the same particle. *(provided as input data)*\n",
    "1. **GNN:** Embed the points into another Euclidean space, this time incorporating neighborhood information. Because each point is aware of its neighbors, the GNN produces a superior embedding to the metric learning stage.\n",
    "1. **Clustering:** Using the GNN's embedding, cluster the points with DBSCAN. Adjust DBSCAN's hyperparameters until the TrackML score is maximized."
